                It was very nice hotel with cleanliness. Staff behavior was good and polite. They welcome us very well.
                Issue was only
                that Lift was not in working and we were allotted to 3rd floor and amenities articles were in corner of
                gallery which
                were giving bad feeling. Breakfast was good and support of the staff was also very nice. Location is not
                good as per
                atmosphere, it is very nearby most of the popular places but self location in a narrow street is not
                good. Overall it
                was a good experience and could recommend.

                Booked a 2 bedroom suite using my timeshare points through RCI back in April for a July 2-9 stay. The
                only glitch was I
                called Hilton directly to confirm my reservation and they couldn't find it despite the reservation
                number provided by
                RCI. I contacted RCI and they assured me I had a reservation. When I arrived my name was registered and
                check-in was a
                breeze. Our suite was a huge 2 bedroom with a full kitchen, dining area and living room. Having stayed
                at other
                timeshare properties, I knew what they layout would be but my brother and his wife were totally blown
                away. It was worth
                it just to see their faces. The resort was quite busy. It's clearly a family oriented place and the pool
                was the place
                to be. The weather was well over 100 degrees the whole week so we mostly soaked in the pool and went out
                for dinner. We
                chose to make breakfast every day in the room, which is a huge money saver. The staff was very friendly.
                I'm sure they
                were all happy to be back at work. They didn't have an airport shuttle but that is apparently in the
                works. Things at
                this resort (as well as other hotels/casinos we went to) are still adjusting to the post-pandemic
                crowds. Fortunately,
                this meant we weren't asked to sit through a timeshare presentation. That area seemed locked up and they
                are probably
                getting staff ready to start doing that again. They do have a marketplace on the first floor where you
                can get all your
                last minute needs (frozen meals, drinks, coffee, etc.). They serve Starbucks in there as well. The pool
                stayed open
                until 10 pm, which was a nice bonus. The nights were still in the 90's. Overall a wonderful room and
                stay. I would
                gladly book another stay here! One more thing - I didn't get my receipt by email as promised, so I
                called the Hilton
                number and again they couldn't find my reservation! It's as if by booking through RCI it only existed
                there on site.
                They had to finally transfer me to the front desk of the actual resort to look up my reservation and
                resend the receipt
                (they had the email wrong). Strange. There seems to be a missing link between RCI and Hilton, but it
                didn't affect my
                stay. Still had a wonderful time.

                The Hilton never disappoints, the staff was friendly, the pool area nice and clean. The best part of our
                stay at the
                Hilton on the Strip was there’s NO casino slots in the Hotel. We will definitely stay here next visit to
                Vegas

                I was so excited to stay in a Hilton, and it was so beautiful when we checked in. It was clean and
                smelled good, right
                up until we opened our room door. It says no smoking but it 100% smelled of cigarettes. The room
                appeared to be nice,
                full kitchen, washer/dryer, ice maker in the freezer, and a separate bedroom and living room with a
                kitchen table,
                though as we looked it started to disappoint. There was a smoke detector sitting on the back of the
                couch, I don’t know
                what that was about. The garbage disposal was nasty. It had a smell and when I put ice and wate r down
                it to clean it,
                it backed up nasty stink, until I was done cleaning it. Room 1-707 garbage disposal clean ✔️
                The counter and behind the sink had sticky all over it. The stove also had crumbs all over behind it,
                gross. And of
                course, with COVID, they weren’t allowing the staff to come in and clean the room during our stay.
                Though they were
                happy to bring extra towels each day, but I would of loved cleaned sheets (but I refuse to make a bed on
                my vacation…I
                thought hotels just did that. I would of been happy to leave while they cleaned it daily.). Anyway….then
                the shower
                happened. I was so angered that I could not get a hot shower for the most part of our stay. It was luke
                warm at best.
                You certainly would not fill that jacuzzi tub in the room.

                I was also disappointed that I could not get a robe, at the HILTON? I was surprised. Also, there was no
                room service,
                the spa wasn’t operating, and the grocery area had minimal items and selection. And the hotel bar closed
                at 10pm.

                This hotel is 100% family friendly, with no casino and bedtime hours of 10pm until 7am. We watched the
                children swim
                from the windows uostairs. It seemed that only thing for children to do. The pool looked nice but I was
                surprised when
                we went to get into the hot tub. It was as hot as my shower….NOT! And dirty!! The pool, the pool area,
                people left
                trash, and the leaves and dirt were just accumulating in the pool corners (pool filters were littered
                with garbage and
                leaves). I was surprised they didn’t have someone cleaning the pool and pool area throughout the day.

                The staff was great. Everyone I dealt with had exceptional behaviors and it was a pleasure working with
                them to make our
                stay what it was. I definitely appreciate the fresh towels daily..just sent a text snuff they arrived
                with them in a
                timely manner. Fabulous idea.
